# 🧠 TryHackMe Write-Ups by Rafif Asif

Welcome to my collection of TryHackMe room write-ups as I start my hands-on journey into cybersecurity.

I’m currently learning the basics of cybersecurity while studying for the **CompTIA Security+** certification, and using platforms like **TryHackMe** to gain real-world, practical experience. Everything here is part of my commitment to go from **no tech background to a cybersecurity professional.**

## 🚀 Why I'm Doing This

- To build real-world skills, not just read about them  
- To hold myself accountable and track my growth  
- To show future employers I can do more than memorize facts  
- To inspire other beginners starting from scratch
